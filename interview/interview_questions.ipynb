    "\n",
    "I love financial options. I love to trade options and I love valuing options because they’re different and present some unique challenges in figuring out their worth. They’ve gotten a little bit of a bad rap in the news because they can be risky. But if used correctly, they can actually present less risk than owning the stock itself. And because of the use of leverage, the returns can be greater as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve been working on a couple option valuations lately, and maybe this shows how big of a nerd I am, but I find them very interesting. Anyone that’s ever dealt with options has heard of the Black-Scholes model of valuing options. But did you know there are other, more-flexible methods for valuing options? Below is a summary of a couple of the different option valuation methods, along with their strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Black-Scholes\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model is the most popular method for valuing options and can be quite accurate. It relies on fixed inputs (current stock price, strike price, time until expiration, volatility, risk free rates, and dividend yield). The good thing is, you don’t have to be a math whiz, just find the right inputs and use a good online calculator (here’s a decent one). For most regular options, using a Black-Scholes model is good enough. The downside to the Black-Scholes model is that it’s a black box calculator and it doesn’t offer the flexibility required to value options with non-standard features, such as a price reset feature or a mandatory exercise requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial models\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the Black Scholes model, a binomial model breaks down the time to expiration into a number of time intervals, or steps. At each step, the model predicts two possible moves for the stock price, (one up and one down) by an amount calculated using volatility and time to expiration. This produces a binomial distribution of underlying stock prices. The model produced is a theoretical representation of all the possible paths that the stock price could take during the life of the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the model -- i.e. at expiration of the option -- all the terminal option prices for each of the final possible stock prices are known as they simply equal their intrinsic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next the option prices at each step of the model are calculated working back from expiration to the present. The option prices at each step are used to derive the option prices at the next step of the model. Any adjustments to stock prices (at an ex-dividend date) or option prices (as a result of early exercise of American options) are worked into the calculations at the required point in time. As you work your way back to the present, you are left with one option price.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that if no alterations are made and the same inputs as a Black-Scholes model are used, and when using a sufficient number of steps, the results of the binomial model and a Black Scholes model will be identical. However, the binomial model also offers more flexibility because the user can alter the inputs at each step in the process to account for differences in the ability to exercise a particular option that shows non-standard features. The downside is that binomial models are complex to construct and depending on the number of steps used in the model, can be incredibly unwieldy in terms of size of the spreadsheet and computing power needed to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation uses computerized modeling to predict outcomes. The model first generates a random number based on a probability distribution. The random number then uses the additional inputs of volatility and time to expiration to generate a stock price. The generated stock price at the time of expiration is then used to calculate the value of the option. The model then calculates results over and over, each time using a different set of random values from the probability functions. Depending upon the model, the number of uncertainties and the probability distributions used, a Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of recalculations before it is complete. For option models, Monte Carlo simulation typically relies on the average of all the calculated results as the option price.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways the Monte Carlo provides the best of both the Black-Scholes and binomial worlds. With the right software, (here’s a good, inexpensive option) you can provide the inputs and let the model do its thing, ultimately spitting out a result (although it takes a little longer than the Black-Scholes calculation). And while it isn’t as unwieldy to use a binomial model, it still provides flexibility in the inputs that can be used.\n"

    "Advantages of expected shortfall\n",
    "\n",
    "As Artzner et al (1999) pointed out some time ago, ES has better theoretical properties than VAR. If two portfolios are combined, the total ES usually decreases - reflecting the benefits of diversification – and certainly never increases. By contrast, the total VAR can – and in practice occasionally does – increase. This is discussed in Hull (2006). To use the terminology of Artzner et al, ES is \"coherent\" because it has certain fundamental properties they consider such a measure should have. In particular, ES never increases as portfolios are diversified. VAR is not coherent because it does not have this particular property.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more pragmatic reason for preferring ES to VAR in risk management. It is tempting for a trader to follow a trading strategy that is nearly always profitable, but occasionally blows up.5 This strategy should be prevented by an ES risk limit, but may be possible when a VAR risk limit is used. Many banks have used ES internally for years, even though VAR is necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back-testing and accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected shortfall has disadvantages as well as advantages, of course. First, it is difficult to back-test. When a one-day 99% VAR model based on the most recent historical data is being back-tested, we can observe the number of exceptions that would have been encountered if the model had been used in the past, and test whether this is significantly different from what is expected. Back-testing a one-day ES model is much more challenging, because we are interested in the average size of the losses when exceptions are observed. A back-testing period of 250 days is usually used by regulators. This can be expected to give about 6 exceptions when a 97.5% confidence limit is used, which is a small sample. However, Acerbi and Szekely (2014) seem to get reasonable results when experimenting with three different tests of ES and standard distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key point is that back-testing a stressed model, whether VAR or ES, is not possible because we are interested in whether the model performs well for another stressed period, but we do not have another such period to use for testing. The use of varying time horizons in FRTB is an added complication in back-testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Basel Committee has presumably recognised this because the review requires the back-testing of a one-day VAR model calculated in the usual way from recent historical data. We are therefore in the strange position where the risk measure being back-tested is quite different from that used to calculate capital.\n",

    "Another disadvantage of ES is that estimates of the measure may not be as accurate as estimates of VAR. Yamai and Yoshiba (2002) looked at this. They found that for a certain number of observations and a certain confidence level, the accuracy of VAR and ES is about the same when the loss is normally distributed, but that VAR estimates are more accurate than ES estimates when the losses have fat tails.6 This means capital calculated from ES may be less stable than capital calculated from VAR."

    "The main fundamental difference between options and futures lies in the obligations they put on their buyers and sellers. An option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation to buy (or sell) a certain asset at a specific price at any time during the life of the contract. A futures contract gives the buyer the obligation to purchase a specific asset, and the seller to sell and deliver that asset at a specific future date, unless the holder's position is closed prior to expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key difference between options and futures is the size of the underlying position. Generally, the underlying position is much larger for futures contracts, and the obligation to buy or sell this certain amount at a given price makes futures more risky for the inexperienced investor.\n"

    "Sometimes referred to as the historical volatility, this term usually used in the context of derivatives. While the implied volatility refers to the market's assessment of future volatility, the realized volatility measures what actually happened in the past. The measurement of the volatility depends on the particular situation. For example, one could calculate the realized volatility for the equity market in March of 2003 by taking the standard deviation of the daily returns within that month. One could look at the realized volatility between 10:00AM and 11:00AM on June 23, 2003 by calculating the standard deviation of one minute returns.\n"

    "\n",
    "In financial mathematics, the implied volatility of an option contract is that value of the volatility of the underlying instrument which, when input in an option pricing model (such as Black–Scholes) will return a theoretical value equal to the current market price of the option. A non-option financial instrument that has embedded optionality, such as an interest rate cap, can also have an implied volatility. Implied volatility, a forward-looking and subjective measure, differs from historical volatility because the latter is calculated from known past returns of a security.\n"
